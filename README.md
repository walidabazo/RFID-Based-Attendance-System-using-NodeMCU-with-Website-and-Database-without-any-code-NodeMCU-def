### Overview

There are many methods to track the attendance of an individual. A few years ago, when Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) electronics were still in their adolescence stages, the time stamping technique was greatly followed. As software programming and technology progressed, especially in electronics, they gave way to a much more secure and reliable arrangement known as RFID Attendance System.

The RFID-based attendance system is developed using PHP, CSS, and Javascript working by WIFI. An RFID Based Attendance System Using NodeMCU is a modern attendance system. Hence, is a very interesting project. It can be useful in different places like schools, Colleges, industry, and private organizations to register the attendance of students, teachers, employees, etc. to tabulate monthly/daily working hours automatically. When the person with the correct RFID card swipes his/her RFID tag, His/Her arrival time will be stored in the system Log. Usually, when the same person swipes his/her RFID tag again, the system will save it as his/her leaving time. 

The RFID attendance system is developed with the IoT platform. We have used the NodeMCU ESP8266 development board with MF-RC522 Module to send the card UID to the PHP Web app and store data in the website database. Basically, the admin plays an important role in the management of this system.
The RFID-based attendance system is developed very easily setup on your server

What is RFID RC522 ??
RC522 is the highly integrated RFID card reader which works on non-contact 13.56mhz communication, is designed by NXP as low power consumption, low cost, and compact size read and write chip, and is the best choice in the development of smart meters and portable hand-held devices. RFID is the short form of Radio Frequency Identification. RFID modules use electromagnetic fields for transferring data between the card and the reader. Different RFID tags are attached to objects like keychains, cards, etc. and whenever we place that object in front of the RFID reader, the reader reads that tag. The next benefit of RFID is that it doesn’t require to be in a straight line to get detected. Unlike a barcode, in RFID there’s no such restriction. So, here are some features of RFID RC522.
